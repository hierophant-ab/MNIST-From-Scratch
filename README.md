# MNIST Digit Classification Using Neural Networks from Scratch

## Overview
This project focuses on building a **neural network from scratch** to classify handwritten digits from the **MNIST dataset**. The model is implemented without relying on high-level deep learning libraries, providing a deeper understanding of the mechanics of neural networks, including forward propagation, backpropagation, and optimization.

## Features
- Fully connected **neural network implemented from scratch** in Python.
- Trained and evaluated on the **MNIST dataset** (28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits 0â€“9).
- **Performance analysis** includes:
  - **Confusion Matrix**
  - **Classification Report**
  - **ROC Curve & AUC**
  - **Accuracy and Loss curves over epochs**
